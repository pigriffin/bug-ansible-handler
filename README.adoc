= bug-iansible-handler

If a handler is called through a chain of roles, the handler is skipped if the first path that results in the handler being called has a false 'when:' clause.

- site.yml calls role-a
- role-a has two metas calling role-b. One has a 'when: 1 == 2' clause that is always false, the second has no 'when'
- role-b has a task that notifies a handler in role-c

If the first dependency in role-a has the false 'when' clause, the handler is skipped and launches the debugger. From the debugger 'task.when' shows `['1 == 2']`.
If the 'when' clause is moved to the second dependency in role-a,, the handler is called normally.

So it seems for some reason any 'when:' clause in the first dependency encountered is copied into the handler.
